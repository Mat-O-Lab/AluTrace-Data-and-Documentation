# AluTraceProject
The AluTrace Project was a project funded by the german Ministry of Economics, Labor and Tourism Baden-W端rttemberg (Ministerium f端r Wirtschaft, Arbeit und Tourismus Baden-W端rttemberg) from January 21st 2020 through December 31st 2021 under the case number 34-4224.044/21. Aim of the project was to digitally link data and knowledge silos that arise over industrial product development and manufacturing cycles. This linked data was used in order to answer a particular use case, allowing a design engineer to optimize a component with regard to lightweight design for additive manufacturing. 

The project consortium, consisting of the [Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics, Ernst-Mach-Institut, EMI](https://www.emi.fraunhofer.de/en/business-units/automotive/research/digitales-datenmanagement.html), [Fraunhofer Institute for 
Mechanics of Materials IWM](https://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de/) and [fem Research Institute for Precious Metals and Metal Chemistry](https://www.fem-online.de/) used legacy data and supplemented it specifically to generate RDF data. The RDF data is provided decentrally via the very first implementation of the [Materials Data Space:R:](https://www.materials.fraunhofer.de/de/strategische-initativen/materials-data-space-/aktuelles-/erste-mds-implementierung-.html).  

### Deliverables
This repository contains the deliverables for this project, including 
- the RDF data,   
- the SPARQL queries written for the project along with,
- the returns of those SPARQL queries, 
- the final report, 
- an supporting set of presentation slides.
