# What do these queries describe?
The queries are to be used with one of the aligned RDF data sets:
- AluTrace-Web4GenMet-LD.trig
- AluTrace-Web4GenMet-Ld-inferred.ttl

You can find the queries that were necessary to fulfil the AluTrace use case:
- **AluTrace_MaterialCharacteristicsDependentOnProcessParameters.sq**
  - This query retrieves from the AluTrace-LD data set the materials characteristics that were observed in dependency from varying process parameters in laser powder bed fusion. 
- **Web4GenMet_MaterialCharacteristicsDependentOnProcessParameters.sq**
  - This query retrieves from the Web4GenMet-LD data set the materials characteristics that were observed in dependency from varying process parameters in laser powder bed fusion.
